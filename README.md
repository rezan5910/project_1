## Overview

Our Recipe Search App is the solution for people who are looking for inspiration in the kitchen. With numerous recipe websites available, it can be difficult and time-consuming to find the perfect dish. That's where our app comes in.

The concept behind our app is to provide a one-stop-shop for people who want to find recipes quickly and easily. Our app allows users to search for recipes based on ingredients, cuisine, meal type, and dietary restrictions. The results are displayed in a clear and concise format, complete with instructions and ingredient lists from the source of the recipe.

With our Recipe Search App, you'll never have to spend time sifting through countless websites again. Find the perfect recipe in just a few clicks!

### The Project



### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot]([https://getfireshot.com/](https://getfireshot.com/)) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**
